# About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg), in the [Engineering Systems and Design](https://esd/sutd.edu.sg) pillar. I am fortunate to be advised by the wonderful [Georgios Piliouras](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~georgios/) and supported by the [SUTD President's Graduate Fellowship](https://sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Graduate/Scholarships).

My primary research interest is in applying game theory and optimization to machine learning problems, though I am also broadly interested in the intersection between ethics, social choice theory and game theory. My PhD thesis revolves around understanding the algorithmic and dynamical properties of online learning algorithms such as [Multiplicative Weights Update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_weight_update_method) in various contexts, from multi-agent to quantum settings.

Prior to embarking on my PhD journey, I was an undergrad (also at SUTD), where I studied Operations Research in the ESD pillar. I graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2019.

Outside of research, I am an over-analyzer of movies and an avid reader of poetry. I also run tabletop role-playing games regularly and sing in a choir.

#### Poincaré recurrence of endogenously evolving network Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
<img src="files/egtsquared.gif" alt="description of gif" width="600"/> 
The system shown here is a 5-player Rock-Paper-Scissors type game played on a graph (i.e. each player plays against their neighbours on a predefined graph). We show the replicator trajectories of the first strategy (i.e. probability of playing Rock) of each player via a 4D embedding. The animation shows that for a range of initial conditions, the players trajectories remain bounded, a necessary step in proving that the system is Poincaré recurrent.
