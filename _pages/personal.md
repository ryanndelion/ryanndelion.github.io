## My Name and Background
My last name is Sim (沈/*shěn*  in Mandarin), and is pronounced how it's spelt. My Chinese given name is Wei Jian (伟健/*wěi jiàn* in Mandarin), though I usually prefer to use my English name. I am from Ipoh, Malaysia and am always happy to talk at length about the cultures, cuisines and histories of my home country and the South East Asian region in general.

In addition to research I spend a lot of time exploring personal interests, which mostly revolve around music, poetry, tabletop games and film.

## Personal Interests
- I have joined [One Chamber Choir](https://www.instagram.com/onechamberchoir/) as a Bass! In October, we will be competing in the [European Grand Prix (Maribor)](https://www.egpchoral.com/about-us/maribor/).
- I'm writing a musical with the [SoDa Players](https://www.facebook.com/Sodaplayers/), an amateur musical theatre troupe.
- I am passionate about wildlife and forest conservation in my home country, and have recently been involved in conservation efforts to save the Malayan Tiger (a critically endangered species endemic to Peninsular Malaysia). I am also excited about the potential benefits of applying game theoretic and optimization ideas to aid conservation efforts worldwide.
