In addition to research I like doing a bunch of other things, mostly revolving around music, tabletop games and film.

## Current Projects
- I am running a tabletop role-playing game workshop for [Glyph Community](https://www.glyphcommunity.com/), a children's charity in Singapore. 
- I have joined [One Chamber Choir](https://www.instagram.com/onechamberchoir/) as a Bass!
- I'm writing a musical with the [SoDa Players](https://www.facebook.com/Sodaplayers/), an amateur musical theatre troupe.
